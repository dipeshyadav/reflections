How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    very difficult almost impossible if the file was really huge.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    its good to have that actually bec it lets us knw about all the changes made to it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros - give us a chance to save at what time we want
    cons - human error,if we forget to save then what happen

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    bec one change can effect multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - will give each version of file
    git diff - will give the diff between two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    very much confident

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for every project now ownwards
